Title: Analyizing IBM heap and thread dumps

print threaddump from javacore file

look for section like following in

  0SECTION       THREADS subcomponent dump routine
  NULL           =================================
  NULL
  1XMCURTHDINFO  Current thread

thats where threaddump start from.

to print all the threads that were stuck on socket read

  for f in *.txt;do
    echo $f `grep -c "3XMTHREADINFO " $f` `grep "4XESTACKTRACE " $f |  grep -c socketRead `
  done

check core file for heap size
  2CIUSERARG               -Xms256m
  2CIUSERARG               -Xmx1024m

"IBM Monitoring and Diagnostic Tools for Java - Memory Analyzer" works for analyzing
.phd dump files.

java/bin/jdmpview
java/jre/bin/jextract

$jextract -help
Usage: jextract dump_name [output_filename] [options]
 output filename defaults to dump_name.zip
    or dump_name.xml if -nozip option specified
 options:
   -help         print this usage message
   -nozip        don't create an archive file
   -v            enable verbose output

jextract is useful with coredumps.

Using the trace formatter

The trace formatter is a Java™ program that runs on any platform and can format
a trace file from any platform. The formatter, which is shipped with the SDK in
core.jar, also requires a file called TraceFormat.dat, which contains the
formatting templates. This file is shipped in jre/lib.

To use the trace formatter, type:

  java com.ibm.jvm.format.TraceFormat <input_filespec> [<output_filespec>] [options]

where

<input_filespec>  is the name of the binary trace file to be formatted,

<output_filespec> is the optional output filename. If it is not specified,
                  the default output file name is input_filespec.fmt.

The options are:

  -summary
      Prints a summary of the trace file.
  -datdir
      Gives the location of the .dat files for processing a trace files produced
      by a pre-5.0 JVM. The .dat files must be from a JVM with a greater or equal
      version number to the trace files. The .dat files can not be from a 5.0 JVM.
  -uservmid
      Specifies a user string to be inserted in each formatted tracepoint. The
      string aids reading or parsing when several different JVMs or JVM runs are
      traced for comparison. It allows easy identification within the file of
      which JVM owns the trace output that is being inspected.
  -indent
      Specifies that the formatter will indent trace messages at each Entry
      trace point and outdent trace messages at each Exit trace point. The
      default is not to indent the messages.

Examples of formatting binary trace file trace1:

    Produce a summary of the trace file:

    java com.ibm.jvm.format.TraceFormat trace1 -summary

Allocation failures
-------------------
When an attempt is made to allocate to the heap but insufficient memory is
available, an allocation failure is triggered. The output produced depends on the
area of the heap in which the allocation failure occurred.

<af type="nursery">
  Indicates that an allocation failure has occurred when attempting to
  allocate to the new area. The id attribute shows the index of the type of
  allocation failure that has occurred.
    timestamp   shows a local timestamp at the time of the allocation failure.
    intervalms  shows the number of milliseconds elapsed since the previous
                allocation failure of that type.

<minimum>
  Shows the number of bytes requested by the allocation that triggered the
  failure. Following the garbage collection, freebytes might drop by more
  than this amount. The reason is that the free list might have been
  discarded or the Thread Local Heap (TLH) refreshed.
