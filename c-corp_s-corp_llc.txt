C Corporation
=============

    The C Corp is the preferred structure if you intend on seeking VC
    funding or taking the company public. But forming a C Corp
    involves more paperwork, legal fine print and potential double
    taxation.

    A C Corp is a separate entity that can sue and be sued. When it
    comes to taxes, a C Corp is a separate tax payer that files its
    own federal and state (where applicable) tax returns. This means
    that profits are first taxed with the corporation. Then, if the
    corporation decides to take that profit and distribute dividends
    to shareholders, the dividends are taxed again (this time, on each
    shareholder’s personal tax statement).

    If your company is considering raising venture capital down the 
    road, VC firms will most likely choose the C Corporation as the 
    type of legal entity for their investments. 

LLC (limited liability company)
===============================

    Company profits are "passed through" and reported on the personal
    income tax return of the shareholders.

    Protect your personal assets from any potential liabilities of the
    company (whether from an unhappy customer, unpaid supplier or
    anyone else who might pursue legal action).

    LLCs just use an informal operating agreement.

    Income and loss can be allocated disproportionately among the
    owners. With an LLC, this type of agreement is fine. The two
    owners simply agree to the arrangement and they will be taxed
    accordingly to their "operating agreement."

    Members and shareholders are able to pass company losses to their
    personal income reporting.

    In some circumstances, the LLC lets you pass more loss than in an
    S Corporation, most notably when it comes to real estate. In an
    LLC used for real estate investments, members are allowed to add
    the amount of the mortgage to their basis for the purpose of
    computing a loss. Clearly, that can add up to a significant
    difference in your tax statement.

    Multiple class of stock, priorities and preferences, are allowed.
    You can have different membership classes.

    Individual owners of an S Corporation or LLC are liable for any 
    taxes owed on profits - whether that money is retained in the 
    company or put in their wallets. 

S Corporation
=============

    Company profits are "passed through" and reported on the personal
    income tax return of the shareholders.

    Protect your personal assets from any potential liabilities of the
    company (whether from an unhappy customer, unpaid supplier or
    anyone else who might pursue legal action).

    Involves structure, formalities and compliance obligations, which
    can be too burdensome for the solo entrepreneur, in other words, a
    "payroll of one." If you incorporate as an S Corporation, you need
    to set up a board of directors, file annual reports and other
    business filings, hold shareholder’s meetings, keep records of
    your meeting minutes, and generally operate at a higher level of
    regulatory compliance than your business might need or want to
    deal with.

    More restrictions in terms of who can be a shareholder. For
    example, an S Corp cannot have more than 100 shareholders. In
    addition, all individual shareholders of an S Corp must be either
    U.S. citizens or permanent residents.

    Income and loss are assigned to each shareholder strictly based on
    their pro-rata shares of ownership.

    Members and shareholders are able to pass company losses to their
    personal income reporting.

    All shareholders own only one class of stock. An S Corporation can
    have voting and non-voting shares, but cannot have distinctions
    like common stock and preferred stock.

    Individual owners of an S Corporation or LLC are liable for any 
    taxes owed on profits - whether that money is retained in the 
    company or put in their wallets.
