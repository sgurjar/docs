* When G1 GC determines that a garbage collection is necessary, it
  collects the regions with the least live data first (garbage first).
* The G1 GC achieves automatic memory management through the following operations:
  - Allocating objects to a young generation and promoting aged objects into an old generation.
  - Finding live objects in the old generation through a concurrent
    (parallel) marking phase. The Java HotSpot VM triggers the marking
    phase when the total Java heap occupancy exceeds the default threshold.
  - Recovering free memory by compacting live objects through parallel copying.
* The G1 GC is a regionalized and generational garbage collector, which
means that the Java object heap (heap) is divided into a number of equally
sized regions. Upon startup, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) sets the
region size. The region sizes can vary from __1 MB to 32 MB__ depending on
the heap size. The goal is to have no more than __2048__ regions. The eden,
survivor, and old generations are logical sets of these regions and are
not contiguous.
* The G1 GC has a pause time-target that it tries to meet (soft real
time). During young collections, the G1 GC adjusts its young generation
(eden and survivor sizes) to meet the soft real-time target. During
mixed collections, the G1 GC adjusts the number of old regions that are
collected based on a target number of mixed garbage collections, the
percentage of live objects in each region of the heap, and the overall
acceptable heap waste percentage.
* The G1 GC reduces heap fragmentation by incremental parallel copying
of live objects from one or more sets of regions (called Collection Set
(CSet)) into different new region(s) to achieve compaction. The goal is
to reclaim as much heap space as possible, starting with those regions
that contain the most reclaimable space, while attempting to not exceed
the pause time goal (garbage first).
* The G1 GC uses independent Remembered Sets (RSets) to track references
into regions. Independent RSets enable parallel and independent
collection of regions because only a region's RSet must be scanned for
references into that region, instead of the whole heap. The G1 GC uses
a post-write barrier to record changes to the heap and update the RSets.
Garbage Collection Phases
* Apart from evacuation pauses (described below) that compose the
stop-the-world (STW) young and mixed garbage collections, the G1 GC also
has parallel, concurrent, and multiphase marking cycles. G1 GC uses the
Snapshot-At-The-Beginning (SATB) algorithm, which takes a snapshot of
the set of live objects in the heap at the start of a marking cycle. The
set of live objects is composed of the live objects in the snapshot,
and the objects allocated since the start of the marking cycle. The G1
GC marking algorithm uses a pre-write barrier to record and mark objects
that are part of the logical snapshot.
* Young Garbage Collections
  - The G1 GC satisfies most allocation requests from regions added to the
    eden set of regions. During a young garbage collection, the G1 GC collects
    both the eden regions and the survivor regions from the previous garbage
    collection. The live objects from the eden and survivor regions are
    copied, or evacuated, to a new set of regions. The destination region
    for a particular object depends upon the object's age; an object that
    has aged sufficiently evacuates to an old generation region (that is,
    promoted); otherwise, the object evacuates to a survivor region and will
    be included in the CSet of the next young or mixed garbage collection.
* Mixed Garbage Collections    
  - Upon successful completion of a concurrent marking cycle, the G1 GC
    switches from performing young garbage collections to performing mixed
    garbage collections. In a mixed garbage collection, the G1 GC optionally
    adds some old regions to the set of eden and survivor regions that
    will be collected. The exact number of old regions added is controlled
    by a number of flags that will be discussed later (see "Taming Mixed
    GCs"). After the G1 GC collects a sufficient number of old regions
    (over multiple mixed garbage collections), G1 reverts to performing
    young garbage collections until the next marking cycle completes.
  - Phases of the Marking Cycle
    + Initial mark phase: The G1 GC marks the roots during this phase. This
      phase is piggybacked on a normal (STW) young garbage collection.
    + Root region scanning phase: The G1 GC scans survivor regions of the
      initial mark for references to the old generation and marks the referenced
      objects. This phase runs concurrently with the application (not STW)
      and must complete before the next STW young garbage collection can start.
    + Concurrent marking phase: The G1 GC finds reachable (live) objects
      across the entire heap. This phase happens concurrently with the
      application, and can be interrupted by STW young garbage collections.
    + Remark phase: This phase is STW collection and helps the completion
      of the marking cycle. G1 GC drains SATB buffers, traces unvisited live
      objects, and performs reference processing.
    + Cleanup phase: In this final phase, the G1 GC performs the STW
      operations of accounting and RSet scrubbing. During accounting, the
      G1 GC identifies completely free regions and mixed garbage collection
      candidates. The cleanup phase is partly concurrent when it resets and
      returns the empty regions to the free list.

## Important Defaults
| Flag | Note |
| ------- | ------- |
| `-XX:G1HeapRegionSize=n`  | Sets the size of a G1 region. The value will be a power of two and can range from 1MB to 32MB. The goal is to have around 2048 regions based on the minimum Java heap size.|
| `-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200`  | Sets a target value for desired maximum pause time. The default value is 200 milliseconds. The specified value does not adapt to your heap size.|
| `-XX:G1NewSizePercent=5`  | Sets the percentage of the heap to use as the minimum for the young generation size. The default value is 5 percent of your Java heap. This is an experimental flag. See "How to unlock experimental VM flags" for an example. This setting replaces the -XX:DefaultMinNewGenPercent setting. This setting is not available in Java HotSpot VM, build 23.|
| `-XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=60`  | Sets the percentage of the heap size to use as the maximum for young generation size. The default value is 60 percent of your Java heap. This is an experimental flag. See "How to unlock experimental VM flags" for an example. This setting replaces the -XX:DefaultMaxNewGenPercent setting. This setting is not available in Java HotSpot VM, build 23.|
| `-XX:ParallelGCThreads=n`  | Sets the value of the STW worker threads. Sets the value of n to the number of logical processors. The value of n is the same as the number of logical processors up to a value of 8. If there are more than eight logical processors, sets the value of n to approximately 5/8 of the logical processors. This works in most cases except for larger SPARC systems where the value of n can be approximately 5/16 of the logical processors.|
| `-XX:ConcGCThreads=n`  | Sets the number of parallel marking threads. Sets n to approximately 1/4 of the number of parallel garbage collection threads (ParallelGCThreads).|
| `-XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=45`  | Sets the Java heap occupancy threshold that triggers a marking cycle. The default occupancy is 45 percent of the entire Java heap.|
| `-XX:G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent=65`  | Sets the occupancy threshold for an old region to be included in a mixed garbage collection cycle. The default occupancy is 65 percent. This is an experimental flag. See "How to unlock experimental VM flags" for an example. This setting replaces the -XX:G1OldCSetRegionLiveThresholdPercent setting. This setting is not available in Java HotSpot VM, build 23.|
| `-XX:G1HeapWastePercent=10`  | Sets the percentage of heap that you are willing to waste. The Java HotSpot VM does not initiate the mixed garbage collection cycle when the reclaimable percentage is less than the heap waste percentage. The default is 10 percent. This setting is not available in Java HotSpot VM, build 23.|
| `-XX:G1MixedGCCountTarget=8`  | Sets the target number of mixed garbage collections after a marking cycle to collect old regions with at most G1MixedGCLIveThresholdPercent live data. The default is 8 mixed garbage collections. The goal for mixed collections is to be within this target number. This setting is not available in Java HotSpot VM, build 23.|
| `-XX:G1OldCSetRegionThresholdPercent=10`  | Sets an upper limit on the number of old regions to be collected during a mixed garbage collection cycle. The default is 10 percent of the Java heap. This setting is not available in Java HotSpot VM, build 23.|
| `-XX:G1ReservePercent=10`  | Sets the percentage of reserve memory to keep free so as to reduce the risk of to-space overflows. The default is 10 percent. When you increase or decrease the percentage, make sure to adjust the total Java heap by the same amount. This setting is not available in Java HotSpot VM, build 23.|

## How to Unlock Experimental VM Flags
To change the value of experimental flags, you must unlock them first. You
can do this by setting `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions` explicitly on
the command line before any experimental flags. For example:

    java -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:G1NewSizePercent=10 -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=75  G1test.jar    

## Recommendations
* Young Generation Size: Avoid explicitly setting young generation
size with the `-Xmn` option or any or other related option such as
`-XX:NewRatio`. Fixing the size of the young generation overrides the
target pause-time goal.
* Pause Time Goals: When you evaluate or tune any garbage collection,
there is always a latency versus throughput trade-off. The G1 GC is
an incremental garbage collector with uniform pauses, but also more
overhead on the application threads. The throughput goal for the G1
GC is 90 percent application time and 10 percent garbage collection
time. When you compare this to Java HotSpot VM's throughput collector,
the goal there is 99 percent application time and 1 percent garbage
collection time. Therefore, when you evaluate the G1 GC for throughput,
relax your pause-time target. Setting too aggressive a goal indicates
that you are willing to bear an increase in garbage collection overhead,
which has a direct impact on throughput. When you evaluate the G1 GC for
latency, you set your desired (soft) real-time goal, and the G1 GC will
try to meet it. As a side effect, throughput may suffer.
* Experiment with the following options when you tune mixed garbage
collections. See "Important Defaults" for information about these options:

| Flag | Note |
| ------- | ------- |
| -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent | For changing the marking threshold. |
| -XX:G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent and -XX:G1HeapWastePercent | When you want to change the mixed garbage collections decisions. |
| -XX:G1MixedGCCountTarget and -XX:G1OldCSetRegionThresholdPercent | When you want to adjust the CSet for old regions. |

## Overflow and Exhausted Log Messages
* When you see to-space overflow/exhausted messages in your logs, the G1
GC does not have enough memory for either survivor or promoted objects,
or for both. The Java heap cannot expand since it is already at its
max. Example messages:

    924.897: [GC pause (G1 Evacuation Pause) (mixed) (to-space exhausted), 0.1957310 secs]
    924.897: [GC pause (G1 Evacuation Pause) (mixed) (to-space overflow), 0.1957310 secs]
    
* To alleviate the problem, try the following adjustments:
  - Increase the value of the -XX:G1ReservePercent option (and the total heap accordingly) to increase the amount of reserve memory for "to-space".
  - Start the marking cycle earlier by reducing the `-XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent`.
  - You can also increase the value of the `-XX:ConcGCThreads` option to increase the number of parallel marking threads.

## Humongous Objects and Humongous Allocations
* For G1 GC, any object that is more than half a region size is considered
a "Humongous object". Such an object is allocated directly in the
old generation into "Humongous regions". These Humongous regions are
a contiguous set of regions. StartsHumongous marks the start of the
contiguous set and ContinuesHumongous marks the continuation of the set.
* Before allocating any Humongous region, the marking threshold is checked,
initiating a concurrent cycle, if necessary.
* Dead Humongous objects are freed at the end of the marking cycle during
the cleanup phase also during a full garbage collection cycle.
* In-order to reduce copying overhead, the Humongous objects are not
included in any evacuation pause. A full garbage collection cycle compacts
Humongous objects in place.
* Since each individual set of StartsHumongous and ContinuesHumongous
regions contains just one humongous object, the space between the end
of the humongous object and the end of the last region spanned by the
object is unused. For objects that are just slightly larger than a
multiple of the heap region size, this unused space can cause the heap
to become fragmented.
* If you see back-to-back concurrent cycles initiated due to Humongous
allocations and if such allocations are fragmenting your old generation,
please increase your -XX:G1HeapRegionSize such that previous Humongous
objects are no longer Humongous and will follow the regular allocation
path.
